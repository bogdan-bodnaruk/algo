/*
Given a 2D grid of size m x n filled with positive numbers, find the path from the top-left corner
to the bottom-right corner that minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move
either down or right at any point in time.

Recommendation:
Use recursion to solve this problem. The function minPathSumRec will be used to recursively
calculate the minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner starting from the top-left corner.
